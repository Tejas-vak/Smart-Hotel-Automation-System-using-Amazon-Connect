# Amazon Lex Bot Configurations

This folder contains two versions of the Amazon Lex bot exported as zip files:

- **Draft Version**: A preliminary version of the Lex bot intended for customization and development.
- **Version 2**: A finalized version of the Lex bot ready for direct import and use in your project.

## ðŸ”§ Usage

If you want to use the Lex bot as-is for your Amazon Connect project, you can directly import the **Version 2** zip file into your Amazon Lex console.

If you wish to make modifications or customize the bot's behavior, start with the **Draft Version**, make your changes, and then publish a new version as needed.
